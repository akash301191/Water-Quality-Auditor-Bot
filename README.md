# Water Quality Auditor Bot

**Water Quality Auditor Bot** is a smart Streamlit application that inspects water samples through image analysis and curated web research. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), OpenAI's GPT-4o, and SerpAPI, this bot generates a structured, markdown-formatted Water Safety Report with personalized purification advice, contamination insights, and actionable resources.

## Features

* **Water Sample Image Upload + Context Input**
  Upload a water image and provide contextual detailsâ€”like source type, usage, surroundings, and observed issues.

* **AI-Powered Visual Contamination Analysis**
  A visual inspection agent detects visible signs of contamination (e.g., murkiness, particles, algae, larvae) and estimates risk level.

* **Contamination Diagnosis & Mapping**
  A dedicated agent reviews the visual findings and your inputs to classify risks by type (biological, chemical, vector-borne) and severity.

* **Curated Web Search Assistant**
  A web agent uses SerpAPI to gather useful links across:

  * DIY purification methods
  * Water safety and hygiene guidelines
  * NGO and public advisories
  * Water filter reviews and recommendations

* **Structured Water Safety Report**
  A final agent weaves everything into a clean, markdown-formatted report with:

  * Visual summaries
  * Risk mapping
  * Recommended purification techniques
  * Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts with links
  * Curated resources by category

* **Download Option**
  Download the complete Water Safety Report as a `.md` file for future use or sharing.

* **Minimal UI**
  Built with Streamlit for a focused and responsive experience.
